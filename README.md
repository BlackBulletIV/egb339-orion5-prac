This project was made for the final prac exam for EGB339 at QUT (scoring full marks). It requires these dependencies:

* [Machine Vision Toolbox for MATLAB](http://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/machine-vision-toolbox)
* [Orion5 server](https://github.com/RAWrobotics/Orion5)

It parses images of the prac exam and source/destination shapes and uses the Orion5 robotic arm to move blocks from source to destination shapes on the exam sheet.
